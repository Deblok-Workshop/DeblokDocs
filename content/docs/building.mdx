Building your own DeblokDocker containers (eg. for a different architecture) is easy!


* Start by cloning the DeblokDocker repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Deblok-Workshop/DeblokDocker
    cd DeblokDocker
    ```


### Easy route
<Steps>
<Step>
You can use `build.sh` to easily build DeblokDocker containers.
```bash
sudo bash build.sh # build all base containers
sudo bash build.sh debian-base # only build one container
```

</Step>
<Step>
Then they are automatically tagged as `deblok-{container_name}`, for example `deblok-debian-base`.
You can use `run.sh` to start it.
```bash
sudo bash start.sh debian-base # use port 3000
sudo bash start.sh debian-base 59000 # use port 59000
```

If you'd like to tag it something else, you can do that (eg. for compatibility with NewDeblok):
```bash
# Tag to Deblok's container URL
sudo docker tag deblok-debian-base:latest ghcr.io/deblok-workshop/deblokdocker/debian-base:latest

# Tag to something else
sudo docker tag deblok-debian-base:latest newdeblok-debian:latest 
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Don't use build.sh route
Literally what the title says
<Steps>
<Step>
Run this single command in your terminal, feel free to change the tag and the build directory.
```bash
sudo docker build -t your-custom-docker-tag:latest ./debian-base
```
</Step>
